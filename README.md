## ‚ùì What is this project about?

It makes recording attendance easy and also save time in online classes (meets), company meetings, seminars very easily, with few clicks.

This project is based on file handling concept in java. The attendance scripts input by user is stored in respective files for every classes and subjects.

## :thinking: Need of this Project

Curently in our online classes The Attendance is recorded manually which is very much time taking and also very much old fashioned.

## :heavy_check_mark: Solution

We came up with a solution that all attendees of the class have to text "hi" in the chat box, which Teacher can copy & paste in our software and the attendance will we recorded. That‚Äôs it.
It now hardly takes 1-2 min to do that.
