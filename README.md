## ❓ What is this project about?

It makes recording attendance easy and also save time in online classes(meets),company meet, seminars very eaisly, with few clicks.

This project is based on file handeling concept in java. The attendance scripts input by user is stored in respective files for every classes and subjects.

## Need of this Project

Curently in our online classes the attendance is recorded manually which was very much time taking and also very much old fashioned.

## Solution

We came up with a solution that all attendies of the class have to text "hi" in the chat box, which Teacher can collect and copy paste in our software and the attendence will we recorded. Thats it.
It now hardly takes 1-2 min to do that.
